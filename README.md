## API testing
Install ruby if you don't already have it, see the docs here:
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

`gem install rspec`

Optional Mac OsX steps:
if you want a nice notifications of test results:

`gem install rspec-nc`

add the following line to .rspec
`--format Nc`


## Notes
At the moment *only the last 200 tweets* are pulled down from the user's timeline
and the stats are based on that

###Future improvements
1. Pagination could be added to include more tweets, although that would increase the response time
2. A local cache could be added to the tweet fetching part, the cache key could come from a flattened hash of the twitter params (screen_name + count), with a time based cache invalidation
